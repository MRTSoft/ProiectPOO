Idea:

Dungeons and Dragons game:

Game data: 
	Matrix map with values representing terrain + loot + monsters(spawn blocks)
	Game object with a singleton PLAYER obj and singleton MAP obj
	Class Hierachy:
		Entity
			- Static  (NO Action)
				- Walls (Can   pass over)
				- Save spots
				- Loot  (Can't pass over)
			- Dynamic (   Action)
				- Player (NO AI)
				- NPC-s  (   AI)


	Action
		- Move
		- Attack
		- Loot **Player only

Game mechanics:
  I. Game states
	1. Not started
	2. In Game
	3. Paused
	4. Game Over

 II. Movement
	1. Player
	2. NPC-s

III. Fighting
	1. Just meele attack (meele range 1 block)
	2. Respawn?
	3. Level up maybe?

IV. Looting (begin with just XP)
	1. Chests (no respawn)
	2. Monsters  (respawn)

Time: steps taken in game
HUD: HP, XP, AD, AR, MAP

Win: exit the map
Loss: Loose XP on death but no level down?

IMPORTANT STUFF:
	- Keep it SIMPLE
	- Make things EASY TO CHANGE!!!
	- Make it work first
